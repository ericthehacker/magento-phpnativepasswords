# EW_NativePasswords

Adds support to Magento to optionally use [PHP's native password hashing](http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php) functionality.

**WARNING**: This is a work in progress, and although I plan to finish it quickly, it is not currently well tested.

## Overview

According to [PHP password hashing FAQ](http://php.net/manual/en/faq.passwords.php#faq.passwords.fasthash), the hashing algorithms used by Magento (MD5 on community, SHA256 on enterprise) are not sufficient, and instead PHP's native functionality should be used.

Coming soon!
